    <h1> Activity 1: Hybrid Renewable Energy System (Solar + Wind)</h1>

    <h3> Explanation</h3>
    <p>
      The hybrid solar–wind system ensures a continuous power supply to a rural health clinic by
      combining two renewable energy sources. Solar photovoltaic panels convert sunlight into DC
      electricity during the day, while a small wind turbine captures kinetic wind energy and
      produces AC power. Both energy sources feed into a charge controller that manages charging
      of a common battery bank, preventing overcharging and deep discharge. The inverter converts
      stored DC power into AC for clinic equipment, lighting, and cold storage. During calm or
      cloudy weather, the hybrid nature ensures that one source compensates for the other,
      guaranteeing reliability. Surplus energy can be exported to the local grid. This system is
      sustainable, cost-effective, and vital for ensuring uninterrupted medical services in
      off-grid regions.
