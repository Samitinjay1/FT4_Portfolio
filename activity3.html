    <h1> Activity 3: Biomass-based Biogas Generation for Dairy Farm</h1>

    <h3> Explanation</h3>
    <p>
      The biogas system converts dairy waste from 100 cattle into clean energy through anaerobic
      digestion. Cattle dung and water are mixed in a slurry tank and fed into a sealed digester.
      Microbial action decomposes the organic matter, releasing methane-rich biogas. This gas is
      collected in a gas holder and supplied to a dual-fuel generator or used directly for cooking
      and heating. The remaining digestate serves as organic fertilizer for crops. By converting
      waste into energy, this system minimizes greenhouse emissions, reduces odor, and provides
      energy self-reliance for rural dairy farms, supporting sustainable agriculture and circular
      economy principles.
