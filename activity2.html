    <h3> Explanation</h3>
    <p>
      The solar water heating system uses solar radiation to provide hot water for hostel residents.
      Flat-plate collectors absorb sunlight and convert it into heat, which is transferred to water
      circulating through copper pipes beneath glass covers. The heated water flows into an insulated
      storage tank, ready for morning and evening use. A circulation pump ensures continuous flow,
      while a temperature sensor regulates operation. On cloudy days, an auxiliary electric heater
      supports heating. The system provides approximately 2000 liters of hot water per day,
      significantly reducing electricity consumption. Such systems promote sustainability, reduce
      carbon emissions, and ensure energy independence for large campuses.
